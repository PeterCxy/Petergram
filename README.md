A patchset of the official Telegram Android client.

This patchset is based on the reverse-engineered smali code of the official client, so that we can keep it up-to-date. Use apktools to reverse-compile the official client, and then apply these patches.

For now the only thing I've done is replacing Telegram's Apple Emojis with Google ones.

Please use your own APP\_ID and APP\_HASH in BuildVars.smali.
